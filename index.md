# Our Goal
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="">
To provide a safe palce to foster the growth of different flow art styles such as gloving, orbiting, hooping, poi, etc.  We hope to provide a venue for UH Manoa students to practice their art, compete, and hold events.  If you do any flow arts or are interested in learning about one, please consider joining the AlohaNation Flowarts RIO at UH Manoa!
